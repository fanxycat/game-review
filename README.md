# Game Review
## Introduction
This repo holds my personal review, analysis or thought of electronic games. I
plan to cover most classic platforms, both retro and modern ones, so that I can
learn from those games and form my own understanding about game, especially
regarding its interaction, artistry and thought.

For details of which games are included, see the index file in each platform's
folder (check links below), since some games like duplicate versions or obvious
poorly designed unplayable junks will certainly not be included.

Although articles in the repo are written in markdown, I will also output pdf
version and maintain them locally, with some excel spreadsheets. This may become
a lifetime work as game as the interactive media will keep evolving, and I hope
this will benefit future study and design of game for myself (and for others if
I luckily do it well) and I will update as frequent as I can. Of course these
articles definitely will be flawed, so if anyone happens to see this and is
interested, feel free to correct my mistakes or discussion any ideas with me. I
really appreciate any kind of help.
